CJ : Shit, my aunt Shaneequa used to live over there! But that bitch got evicted though.
Mahalik : For what? 
CJ : Mice. 
Mahalik : I thought she had rats? 
CJ : No, rats are outside, mice are inside. 
Mahalik : But what if a mouse goes outside does it become a rat, and if a rat is in the house, is it a mouse? 
CJ : I ain't seen no mouse outside. That's what I'm sayin'. 
Mahalik : That's because it's a rat, fool! 
CJ : Damn! You mighta just made fact. That's some real shit right there! A-Ha!
